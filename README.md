# .go.sh: a command line shortener

A simple script to automate routine tasks, so you don't have to remember long commands.

Simple, but more flexible and easier to manage than aliases.

# Getting Started

Make sure `m4` is installed.

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/HackerFoo/.go.sh.git
    source ~/.go.sh/load

See [my personal go functions](https://github.com/HackerFoo/hackerfoo-go-functions) for examples.
